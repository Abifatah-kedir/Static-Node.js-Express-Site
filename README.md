*Additional Enhancements Implemented*

1-Dynamic Skill Colors
     - Each time the page loads, every skill in the list is assigned a unique, randomly generated color (excluding white) for a livelier presentation
2- Interactive Card Styling
    - The .cell element now features a subtle background color and an outward-facing box-shadow that appears on hover, giving the card a lifted, modern feel.
3- Project Title Typography
