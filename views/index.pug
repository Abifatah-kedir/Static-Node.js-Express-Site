    //- Replace with your own heading like 'My Portfolio', or 'Hey, Potential Employers', or 'Let's make the web great together!'

    p Hi <br> In this project, I architected and deployed a fully-featured Node.js application that transforms a single JSON data source into a polished, multi-page website using Express routing and Pug templates.

    .projects-box.box.grid

      //- Use the Pug `each` iterator to loop over the projects in your data file  

        //- Use the example Pug code below and interpolated template literals as needed to dynamically generate:
          //- The paths in the link's href and img's src attributes
          //- The text 'Thumbnail' interpolated with the project title for the img's alt attribute
          //- The project title for the h5 element's text

      each project in projects
        .cell
          a(href=`./project/${project.id}`)
            img.thumbnail(src=`${project.image_urls[0]}` width='5500' height='300')
          h5= project.project_name
